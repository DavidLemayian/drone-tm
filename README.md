# Drone Tasking Manager - Together, We Map - Open.Accurate.Accessible

**Drone TM** is an integrated digital public good solution designed to harness the power of the crowd to generate high-resolution aerial maps of any location. This innovative platform provides drone pilots, particularly in developing countries, with job opportunities while contributing to the creation of high-resolution datasets crucial for disaster response and community resilience.

## Problem Statement

In low-income and disaster-prone areas, the accessibility to near real-time satellite datasets is severely restricted. High-resolution satellite imagery, when available, is often prohibitively expensive and outdated. Full-scale aircraft mapping is not a viable option due to its high costs and operational complexity. Traditional mapping solutions, relying on professional consultants with expensive equipment, often result in delays and lack of locally relevant data. Existing drone operation tools are mostly proprietary and not designed for large-scale collaborative efforts, limiting their effectiveness for community-driven projects.

## Solution

**Drone TM** offers a solution to these challenges by empowering communities to utilize drones for immediate and locally relevant mapping needs. Our platform:

- Provides a user-friendly, inclusive application enabling anyone with a drone, including inexpensive consumer or DIY drones, to contribute to a global repository of free and open aerial imagery.
- Facilitates community-driven drone operations, ensuring immediate response and responsible mapping that considers local needs.
- Coordinates aerial survey activities among multiple pilots through an open-source tasking platform, incorporating tools and processes to ensure coordinated flight plans for effective imagery acquisition.
- Offers a seamless pipeline for processing and dissemination of the collected imagery.

## Vision

Our vision is to create a platform that is not only accessible and user-friendly but also inclusive, enabling widespread participation in creating high-resolution aerial maps. By leveraging the power of community-operated drones, we aim to build a resilient and responsive solution that addresses the needs of low-income and disaster-prone areas.
